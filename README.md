# MPSO-DQN
Title: A Java-based MPSO-DQN Model for Optimized Cloud Task Scheduling in Eclipse using CloudSim

Abstract:

This repository presents a novel, Java-implemented MPSO-DQN model for effective cloud task scheduling, designed for seamless integration within the Eclipse IDE. The model leverages the strengths of both the Multi-Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved performance metrics in cloud computing environments.

Key Features:

Enhanced Task Scheduling: Achieves optimized task scheduling through the synergistic combination of MPSO's global exploration and DQN's learning capabilities.
Platform Agnostic: Implemented in Java for broad compatibility and ease of integration across various cloud platforms.
Eclipse-Friendly: Designed for seamless setup and execution within the familiar Eclipse IDE, simplifying development and experimentation.
Benefits:

Performance Optimization: Potentially reduces costs, accelerates execution times, and improves overall resource utilization in cloud environments.
Customization Potential: Offers flexibility for tailoring the model to specific cloud configurations and scheduling requirements.
Community Contribution: Open-source nature fosters collaboration and encourages contributions from the cloud computing community.
